1. Animations for horizontal and vertical Strike only differ in the arms, so use the "Strike" body base and add the corresponding arm animations

2. Idle and running holding animation is based on the same normal idle and running animations, just change the arms

3. Layer order may vary depending on the animation, so test different layer positions
